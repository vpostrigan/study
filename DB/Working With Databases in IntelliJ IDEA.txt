
Working With Databases in IntelliJ IDEA
+ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv8euZ2gOys

What we’ll cover:
– Creating a simple query: various types of code completion, code snippets, expanding wildcards, and working with subqueries.
– Using the data editor: editable result sets, bulk submit, multiple submit, transposing data, and comparing data.
– Data import/export: import from CSV files, export to JSON or UPDATES/INSERTS, and export to other databases.
— Navigation: searching for database objects, data, SQL code, files, settings, and more.
— Other features: user parameters, the diff tool, and query history.


1) Can show hits when writing SQL queries.

2) Can execute two requests and then compare two files.

Appendix C. Vagrant

At various points in this book we use virtual machines to demonstrate a technique for Docker
that requires a full machine representation, or even multiple virtual-machine orchestration.
Vagrant offers a simple way to start, provision, and manage virtual machines from the command line,
and it’s available on several platforms.

[Setting up]
Go to https://www.vagrantup.com and follow the instructions from there to get set up.

[GUIs]
When running vagrant up to start up a virtual machine, Vagrant reads the local file
called Vagrantfile to determine the settings.

A useful setting that you can create or change within the section for your provider is the gui one:

v.gui = true

For example, if your provider is VirtualBox, a typical config section might look like this:

Vagrant.configure(2) do |config|
  config.vm.box = "hashicorp/precise64"

  config.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |v|
    v.memory = 1024
    v.cpus = 2
    v.gui = false
  end
end
copy
You could change the v.gui line’s false setting to true (or add it if it isn’t already there)
before running vagrant up to get a GUI for the running VM.

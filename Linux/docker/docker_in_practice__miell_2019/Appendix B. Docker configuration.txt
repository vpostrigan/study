Appendix B. Docker configuration
At various points in this book you’re advised to change your Docker configuration to make
changes permanent on starting up your Docker host machines.
Appendix B will advise you on the best practices to achieve this.
The operating system distribution you use will be significant in this context.


[Configuring Docker]
The location of the config files for most mainstream distributions is listed in table B.1.

Table B.1. Docker configuration file locations
Distribution                   Configuration
--------------------------------------------
Ubuntu, Debian, Gentoo   	/etc/default/docker
OpenSuse, CentOS, Red Hat	/etc/sysconfg/docker

Note that some distributions keep the configuration to a single file, whereas others use a directory
and multiple files. For example, on Red Hat Enterprise License, there’s a file
called /etc/sysconfig/docker/docker-storage, which by convention contains configuration relating
to storage options for the Docker daemon.

If your distribution doesn’t have any files that match the names in table B.1,
it’s worth checking for an /etc/docker folder, as there may be relevant files in there.

Within these files, arguments to the Docker daemon’s startup command are managed.
For example, when edited, a line such as the following allows you to set the starting arguments
for the Docker daemon on your host.

DOCKER_OPTS=""
copy
For example, if you want to change the location of Docker’s root directory from the default
(which is /var/lib/docker), you might change the preceding line as follows:

DOCKER_OPTS="-g /mnt/bigdisk/docker"

[Restarting Docker]


[Restarting with systemctl]

$ systemctl stop docker
$ systemctl start docker

Or you can just restart:

$ systemctl restart docker

Check the progress by running these commands:

$ journalctl -u docker
$ journalctl -u docker -f


[Restarting with service]

$ service docker stop
$ service docker start

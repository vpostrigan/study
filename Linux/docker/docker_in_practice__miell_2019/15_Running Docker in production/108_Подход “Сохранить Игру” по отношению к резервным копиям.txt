THE “SAVE GAME” APPROACH TO BACKUPS


For such critical systems, it can pay to take the simple but effective approach of backing up the Docker service containers.
Although your database is likely to be separate from your Docker infrastructure, the state of config, code, and logs can be stored in a registry with a couple of simple commands.

PROBLEM

You want to keep backups of Docker containers.

SOLUTION


Following Docker best practices and taking advantage of some Docker features can help you avoid the need to store container backups.
As one example, using a logging driver as described in technique 102 instead of logging to the container filesystem means logs don’t need to be retrieved from the container backups.


Listing 15.8. Committing and pushing a backup container
DATE=$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)                                                1
 TAG="your_log_registry:5000/live_pmt_svr_backup:$(hostname -s)_${DATE}"   2
 docker commit -m="$DATE" -a="Backup Admin" live_pmt_svr $TAG              3
 docker push $TAG                                                          4

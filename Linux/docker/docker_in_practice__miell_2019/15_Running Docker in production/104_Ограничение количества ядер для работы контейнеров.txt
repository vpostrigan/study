RESTRICTING THE CORES A CONTAINER CAN EXECUTE ON

By default, Docker allows containers to execute on any cores on your machine.
Containers with a single process and thread will obviously only be able to max out one core,
but multithreaded programs in a container (or multiple single-threaded programs)
will be able to use all your CPU cores. You might want to change this behavior if you have a container
that’s more important than others—it’s not ideal for customer-facing applications to have
to fight for the CPU every time your internal daily reports run.
You could also use this technique to prevent runaway containers from locking you out of SSH to a server.

PROBLEM

docker run ubuntu:14.04 sh -c 'cat /dev/zero >/dev/null'


// использовать только первое ядро
docker run --cpuset-cpus=0 ubuntu:14.04 sh -c 'cat /dev/zero >/dev/null'

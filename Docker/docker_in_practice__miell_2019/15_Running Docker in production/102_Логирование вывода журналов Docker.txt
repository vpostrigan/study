LOGGING YOUR DOCKER LOGS OUTPUT

By default, Docker logs are captured within the Docker daemon, and you can access these with the docker logs command.
As you’re probably aware, this shows you the output of the container’s main process.

This technique requires Docker version 1.6.1 or higher.


Journald is a system service that collects and stores logging data.
 It creates and maintains a structured index of logs received from a variety of sources.
 The logs can be queried with the journalctl command.


[Logging to syslog]
$ docker run --log-driver=syslog ubuntu echo 'outputting to syslog'
outputting to syslog


$ grep 'outputting to syslog' /var/log/syslog
Jun 23 20:37:50 myhost docker/6239418882b6[2559]: outputting to syslog


[Logging to journald]

Outputting to a journal daemon looks similar:
$ docker run --log-driver=journald ubuntu echo 'outputting to journald'
outputting to journald
$ journalctl | grep 'outputting to journald'
Jun 23 11:49:23 myhost docker[2993]: outputting to journald


[Applying across all containers]
DOCKER_OPTS="--dns 8.8.8.8 --dns 8.8.4.4"

change it to this:
DOCKER_OPTS="--dns 8.8.8.8 --dns 8.8.4.4 --log-driver syslog"
